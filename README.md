Retailers create and sell them: Gift cards are essentially pre-paid debit cards issued by specific stores or brands. They represent a monetary value that has been paid for by someone.
Secure codes: The codes on gift cards are unique and generated through secure systems by the issuing company. They are not random numbers that can be guessed or "generated" by a third party.
Activation: Gift cards typically need to be activated at the time of purchase by a legitimate retailer before they can be used.
If you're looking for legitimate ways to get gift cards, consider these options:

Purchase them: The most straightforward way is to buy them directly from the retailer or a trusted third-party seller.
Earn them through legitimate reward programs: Some companies offer gift cards as rewards for surveys, shopping, or other activities. Examples include:
Swagbucks, MyPoints, Opinion Outpost: These platforms reward you for tasks like surveys, watching videos, and online shopping.
Credit card reward programs: Many credit cards offer points or cashback that can be redeemed for gift cards.
Company promotions: Keep an eye out for legitimate promotions from retailers where they might offer gift cards as incentives for purchases or sign-ups.
